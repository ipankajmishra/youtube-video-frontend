## Features

- In search bar you can search for any keyword like cricket, football etc.
- List of videos will come along with their title, description and thumbnail.
- There is a provision to go next and previosus page.
- For next and previous page youtube API is not getting called. The result will come from the data that is stored by the background sync.
- Definition of background sync is Once the search query is initiated the first set of results will be returne and background sync will start. It will update the result after every 60 seconds and store the data.
- Next time when the request will come for next and previous page, it will redirected to the data which is stored with us. Its basically beahving like a caching mechanism.
- Multiple Youtube API keys are added. If one get exhausted it will automatically take the next available API key and push the exhaused api key for cooling. It is like poping from the available key's stack and push to the cooling keys Queue.
